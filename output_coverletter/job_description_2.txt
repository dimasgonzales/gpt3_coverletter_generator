Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing in response to your job posting for a Senior Data Scientist. With my U.S. citizenship and more than seven years of experience in data engineering, machine learning, and software development, I am confident that I am the ideal candidate for this role.

During my career, I have worked with a variety of programming languages, such as Python, SQL, and JavaScript, as well as development capabilities like MLOps, Data Engineering, Cloud DevOps, and Microservice Development. I have also built software and supporting tests to implement features, researched and documented business processes to distill the technical requirements, and mentored junior associates.

At my current position as Master Engineer at Texas Capital Bank, I have built a cloud-first data lake and data warehouse platform for the entire enterprise, migrated three business processes off legacy warehouse solutions to a new data warehouse platform, and led the development of two net-new business capabilities on the data platform. I have also codified architecture design patterns and interviewed and approved engineering candidates.

My qualifications also include a BS in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University and extensive experience with Microsoft Azure, including certification in machine learning. I have also developed public AI-related projects available on GitHub.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to the Data Science group at Deloitte and helping to realize the Deloitte Audit and Assurance vision of an AI-enabled audit. I am confident that my skills and experience make me the perfect candidate for this position and I look forward to discussing my application further.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dimas Gonzales
