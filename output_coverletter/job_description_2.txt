Dear Ms. Kincaid,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Data Scientist position at Deloitte. With over 7 years of experience in machine learning, data analysis, and software development, I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to the success of your organization.

As my resume reflects, I have a BS in Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Masters in Data Science from the University of Oregon. I have 3+ years of industry experience designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models and have extensive experience with Python and relevant libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.). I also have a solid understanding of machine learning model development life cycles, as well as experience with version control practices and tools (Git, etc.). Additionally, I have experience using common machine learning and deep learning libraries and techniques, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and big data platforms.

In my current role at Capital One, I have been leading the development of new microservices and managing team planning boards and processes (Jira). I have also been responsible for conducting interviews with engineering candidates and mentoring junior associates.

I am confident that my experience and qualifications make me an ideal candidate for the Senior Data Scientist role at Deloitte. I am excited to join a team of talented professionals in a fast-paced yet collaborative startup-like environment dedicated to realizing the Deloitte Audit and Assurance vision of an AI-enabled audit. I look forward to discussing my qualifications in more detail. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Castillo
