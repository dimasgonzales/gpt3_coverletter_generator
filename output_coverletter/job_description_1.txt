Dear Ms. Kincaid,

I am writing to apply for the Applied Research Scientist position with Western Electric, Inc. as recently advertised. With a PhD in Computer Engineering, an extensive background in analytics, machine learning and data science, and a passion for problem-solving, I am confident that I am a great fit for the job.

My current role as a Senior Engineer at Texas Capital Bank has provided me the opportunity to develop a cloud-first data lake and data warehouse platform for the entire enterprise, as well as migrate three business processes off legacy warehouse solutions. I have also codified architecture design patterns and interviewed and approved engineering candidates. My past experience at Tiger Analytics, Capital One, and CAPSHER Technology has provided me with the skills necessary to excel in this role, including MLOps, Data Engineering, Cloud DevOps, and Microservice development.

I believe my qualifications, experience, and enthusiasm make me an ideal candidate for the position. I am eager to discuss the role and my qualifications in more detail with you. Please find my resume attached.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Castillo
