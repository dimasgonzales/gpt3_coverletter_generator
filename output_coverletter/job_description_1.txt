Dear Ms. Kincaid,

I am writing to apply for the Applied Research Scientist position with Amazon Science. With a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering and over seven years of experience in software engineering, I believe I have the necessary qualifications to exceed your expectations for this role.

In my most recent role as a Master Engineer at Texas Capital Bank, I was responsible for building a cloud-first data lake and data warehouse platform for the entire enterprise. I also migrated three business processes off legacy warehouse solutions and led the development of two net-new business capabilities on the data platform. During this time, I was recognized with the “BullDog” CTO award for delivery of the enterprise data warehouse platform. 

Prior to this, I had the opportunity to work as a Senior Data Engineer at Tiger Analytics, where I partnered with client teams to develop data warehouse services, integrate third-party systems, and identify process improvements. I also migrated 37 manually managed batch jobs to a CICD platform.

I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to the Amazon Science team. I have a strong background in programming languages such as Python and SQL, as well as development capabilities such as MLOps, data engineering, cloud DevOps, and microservice development. I also have a proven track record of developing and implementing models using programming and scripting.

I have attached my resume for your review and I am looking forward to speaking with you about this opportunity. Please feel free to contact me at 890-372-1262 or cmleroix@anywhere.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Castillo
